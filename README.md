# HTML-fun
Ideas that I made real with basic HTML, JS, and CSS (not much CSS)

I had time. It's summer! The first thing in here will be a calculator I whipped up in 3 days. More projects coming, assuming I can think of ideas for them

I have now added a playable snake game (2 days to program)

A school-year project now: 2048, but with Pikachus!

To use these files: download the ones from your desired program (so only the 4 snake files, for example). Then get rid of the descriptor at the end of the filename (the " (Snake)" in my example). Then run!
